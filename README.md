# Pull the Pencil

 Pull the Pencil Clone Game for Digital Game Design Final Project. This was from 2022.

I designed the levels, created the UI, modeled several assets for levels 1–5, and conducted playtesting.  
The game can be launched from the Starting Scene and is optimized for a 1440×2560 resolution.
